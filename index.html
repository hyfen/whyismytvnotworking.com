				    <h1>What gives?</h1>
					<p>
						Let me guess -- your TV doesn't work. Has your precious <i>Young and the Restless</i> been replaced by a grey blizzard?
						Don't worry - you're part of the millions other Americans who might be experiencing the same problem.
					</p>
					<p>
						So what's going on?<br />
						It's historical actually - you're part of "the most significant advancement of television technology since color TV was introduced" [1]
						As of February 17, 2009, television channels you pick up with your antenna will no longer work.

								<div class="solution">May we recommend instead: hiking, stamp collecting, or spending quality time with your children.</div>

								<div class="solution-title">Sign up for cable or satellite</div>
								<div class="solution">Signing up for a cable subscription will bring your TV back to life -- if you don't mind paying to have *57 Channels (And Nothin' On)*. You can also get satellite, but then you'll have *1000* channels and the same problem.</div>

								<div class="solution-title">Buy a new TV</div>
								<div class="solution">You've been waiting for that perfect excuse to experience the Superbowl on a huge flatscreen. Don't let your spouse read the next option and go shopping (and stimulate our failing economy as a bonus!).</div>

								<div class="solution-title">Get a free* digital convertor</div>
								<div>
									<p>But jokes aside, this recession has probably left you flat-out broke. Thankfully, there's an option that takes a cue from Wall Street executives by letting you skim off Uncle Sam's goodwill. </p>
									<p>As part of our Government's efforts to switch the country over to digital television, they're offering rebates to purchase a device that will inject new life into your antique television.</p>
									<p>The digital convertor is a small box that plugs into the back of your TV. Say goodbye to static, say hello once more to the shows you know and love. Most devices on the market cost about $40 and coincidentally, the government is offering a rebate for $50 to help you out.</p>
