# Why is my TV not working?

## Intro

Let me guess -- your TV doesn't work. Has your precious *Young and the Restless* been replaced by a grey blizzard? 

Don't worry - you're part of the millions other Americans who might be experiencing the same problem. 


## What gives?

So what's going on? 

It's historical actually - you're part of "the most significant advancement of television technology since color TV was introduced" [1]

As of February 17, 2009, television channels you pick up with your antenna will no longer work ***. 

**You have to do something - it's gone for good**. Doing the bunny-ear adjustment dance just won't cut it anymore.


## So what the heck can I do?


### 1. Stop watching TV

May we recommend instead: hiking, stamp collecting, or spending quality time with your children.


### 2. Sign up for cable or satellite 

Signing up for a cable subscription will bring your TV back to life -- if you don't mind paying to have *57 Channels (And Nothin' On)*. You can also get satellite, but then you'll have *1000* channels and the same problem.


### 3. Buy a new TV

You've been waiting for that perfect excuse to experience the Superbowl on a huge flatscreen. Don't let your spouse read the next option and go shopping (and stimulate our failing economy as a bonus!). 


### 4. Get a free digital convertor 

But jokes aside, this recession has probably left you flat-out broke. Thankfully, there's an option that takes a cue from Wall Street executives by letting you skim off Uncle Sam's goodwill. 

As part of our Government's efforts to switch the country over to digital television, they're offering rebates to purchase a device that will inject new life into your antique television.

The digital convertor is a small box that plugs into the back of your TV. Say goodbye to static, say hello once more to the shows you know and love. Most devices on the market cost about $40 and coincidentally, the government is offering a rebate for $50 to help you out.
